## Introduction

In this participation, you are given Sections to read from the online book, *The Little Book About OS Development* by Erik Helin and Adam Renberg (https://littleosbook.github.io/). From this book, you will learn how to make a very basic OS called Cafebabe that secures memory and loops infinitely until it is shut-down. We will be using an emulator to run this OS which will be hosted by a Docker container. 


## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

## Assistance
To do well on this task, you should also review the chapters of the course textbook and the relevant course slides. Please see the course instructor or one of the Technology Leaders or departmental tutors if you have questions. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours.
